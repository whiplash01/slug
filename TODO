*Numerical stabilization

   The compressible Reynolds equation can have eliptic or
   hyperbolic characteristics, depending on the situation
   on the situation. Small gaps, with lots of sliding velocity 
   seem to make the simulation blow up.  Moose has support
   for Discontinous Galerkin, DG. That's good for the hyperbolic
   situation, but for when the situation is more eliptic, the
   DG implementation will need stabilization via the Interior
   Penalty Method.

   When the characteristic is elliptic, ei when the sliding 
   velocity is zero, and there are shocks present, there 
   are numerical oscillations, though the solve will converge.

*Time kernels

  Only steady state is supported currently.  Implement time 
  derivative kernel for Compressible Reynolds Eqn.

*Air distribution

  The air distribution system could play an important role in 
  the both the static and dynamic performance of you air bearing
  design.  Be it long slender holes from a plenum to the film,
  or hoses coming from air control solenoids on an active film
  stability control system.  A first step here is to create
  kernels for 1D compressible flow.

  Make gui and Moose Actions for specification of air distribution
  system to minimize input file insanity.

*Suspension modeling

  Implement scalar kernels to model the mass and moment of 
  inertia of the pod as well as the masses, springs, and a
  dampers of the suspension system.

  Make gui and Moose Actions ... cuz this could get messy 
  in the input file.

*Dynamic stiffness and damping coefficient extraction

  Two possible ways: 
  - Formulate compressible Reynolds Eqn as an eigen problem.
  - Brute force, time domain

*Make compressible reynolds pressure kernels so that it takes a vector
 instead of a scalar for the sliding velocity input.  v must be renamed
 to v_surface so that a single Global inputfile variable works.
